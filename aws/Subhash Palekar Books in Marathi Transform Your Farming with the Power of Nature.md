# Subhash Palekar Books in Marathi: A Guide to Zero Budget Natural Farming
 
If you are interested in learning about zero budget natural farming (ZBNF), a method of farming that does not require any external inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, or irrigation, then you might want to check out the books written by Subhash Palekar, a renowned Indian agriculturist and Padma Shri awardee.
 
Subhash Palekar was born in 1949 in Belora, a small village in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. He has an agricultural background and practiced chemical farming for many years before realizing its harmful effects on the soil, water, plants, animals, and human health. He then started searching for alternative ways of farming that are more sustainable and eco-friendly.

He came across the concept of natural farming, which is based on the principle of harmony with nature and using the resources that are naturally available. He developed his own version of natural farming, which he called zero budget natural farming (ZBNF), because it does not involve any monetary investment or dependence on the market.
 
ZBNF is based on four pillars: beejamrutham (microbial seed coating using cow dung and cow urine), jeevamrutham (enhancing soil microbiome using cow dung, cow urine, and other ingredients), achhadana (mulching the soil with crops and crop residues), and waaphasa (maintaining soil aeration and water vapor harnessing).
 
ZBNF has many benefits for farmers, consumers, and the environment. It reduces the costs and risks of farming, increases the yields and quality of crops, provides regular income and climate change resilience for farmers, produces safe and nutritious food for consumers, enhances soil health, water conservation, biodiversity, and coastal ecosystem regeneration for the environment.
 
Subhash Palekar has written many books about ZBNF in different languages, including Marathi. Some of his popular books in Marathi are:
 
- Prakruthi Vyavasayam Subhash Palekar Colour Book: This book explains the basics of ZBNF and its benefits for farmers and nature. It also contains color photographs of ZBNF farms and crops.
- Mossad: Israeli Most Secret Service Book Marathi: This book is a translation of a book by Ronald Payne about the history and operations of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. Subhash Palekar has added his own commentary and analysis from a ZBNF perspective.
- Romance with God: This book is a collection of poems by Subhash Palekar and his family members about their spiritual journey and connection with God through ZBNF.

ZBNF has been adopted by many farmers across India and has shown positive results in terms of productivity, profitability, and sustainability. Here are some examples of farmers who have successfully implemented ZBNF on their farms:

- Vijay Kumar from Kuling Village, Himachal Pradesh: He used the Subhash Palekar Natural Farming method on his 25-bigha land, where he planted cauliflower, peas, potatoes, rajmash, and apple. He applied beejamrit, jivamrit, achhadan, waaphsa, and kashayams (decoctions) as per the ZBNF guidelines. He reported an increase in yield and quality of crops, as well as a reduction in input costs and pest attacks.
- Rajesh Kumar from Nalanda District, Bihar: He switched to ZBNF after facing losses due to chemical farming. He cultivated wheat, paddy, maize, and vegetables on his 2.5-acre land using ZBNF inputs. He claimed that his wheat yield increased from 15 quintals to 25 quintals per acre, his paddy yield increased from 18 quintals to 30 quintals per acre, and his maize yield increased from 12 quintals to 20 quintals per acre. He also said that his soil health improved and his water requirement reduced by 50%.
- Shobha Devi from Anantapur District, Andhra Pradesh: She adopted ZBNF on her 5-acre land where she grew groundnut, millets, pulses, and vegetables. She used cow dung and urine to prepare beejamrit and jivamrit for her crops. She also practiced mulching and intercropping to conserve soil moisture and enhance soil fertility. She stated that her groundnut yield increased from 3 quintals to 8 quintals per acre, her millet yield increased from 2 quintals to 6 quintals per acre, and her vegetable yield increased from 4 quintals to 12 quintals per acre. She also saved money on fertilizers and pesticides and earned more income from selling her organic produce.

These are just some of the many success stories of ZBNF farmers who have transformed their lives and livelihoods by adopting this natural and holistic way of farming.
