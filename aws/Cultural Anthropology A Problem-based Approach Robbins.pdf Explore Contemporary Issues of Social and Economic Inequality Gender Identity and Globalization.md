Cultural anthropology is the study of human cultures, beliefs, practices, values, and social interactions in different contexts and settings. It aims to understand how people make sense of their world and cope with the challenges they face. Cultural anthropology also explores how cultures change over time and how they interact with other cultures.

One of the most popular textbooks for cultural anthropology courses is *Cultural Anthropology: A Problem-based Approach* by Richard H. Robbins and Rachel Dowty Beech. This book uses a hands-on, active-learning approach to encourage critical thinking and discussion among students. It is organized around research problems that anthropologists have studied, rather than topics or themes. This way, students can examine real-world issues and questions that are relevant to their lives and society.
 
Some of the research problems that the book covers include:
 
- How do people adapt to different environments and resources?
- How do people construct their identities and express their differences?
- How do people communicate and use language?
- How do people organize their social relations and political systems?
- How do people create and transmit their culture?
- How do people deal with inequality, conflict, and violence?
- How do people cope with globalization, migration, and cultural change?

The book also provides examples of ethnographic research methods, ethical dilemmas, and applied anthropology projects that show how anthropologists use their knowledge and skills to address real-world problems. The book is updated with the latest data and research findings, as well as contemporary issues such as social media, gender identity, food consumption, and climate change.
 
*Cultural Anthropology: A Problem-based Approach* is a comprehensive, engaging, and accessible introduction to the field of cultural anthropology. It helps students develop a deeper appreciation of human diversity and a critical awareness of their own cultural assumptions. It also prepares them to apply anthropological perspectives and tools to solve problems in their personal, professional, and civic lives.

To illustrate the diversity and complexity of cultural anthropology, here are some examples of research topics and questions that anthropologists have explored:

- How do indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest manage their natural resources and protect their territories from external threats?[^1^]
- How do Muslim women in France negotiate their religious identity and expression in a secular society?
- How do online gamers create and maintain social networks and communities across different platforms and genres?
- How do refugees and immigrants in Canada cope with trauma, displacement, and integration?
- How do hip hop artists in Senegal use music and performance to challenge political oppression and promote social change?

These examples show how cultural anthropology can help us understand the diversity of human experiences and perspectives, as well as the commonalities and connections that bind us together. Cultural anthropology can also help us critically examine our own culture and assumptions, and appreciate the value of other ways of living and thinking.
