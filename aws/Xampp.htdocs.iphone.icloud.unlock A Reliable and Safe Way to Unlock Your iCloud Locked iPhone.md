If you have an iPhone that is locked by iCloud activation and you want to use it without entering the Apple ID and password, you may be interested in a method that allows you to bypass this security feature using XAMPP. XAMPP is a free and open source software that provides a web server environment for testing and developing web applications. In this article, we will show you how to set up XAMPP on your PC and use it to host a custom server that can trick your iPhone into activating without iCloud.
 
## What You Need
 
- A PC running Windows with XAMPP installed. You can download XAMPP from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- An iPhone that is locked by iCloud activation. Make sure it has a SIM card inserted.
- A USB cable to connect your iPhone to your PC.
- iTunes installed on your PC. You can download iTunes from [here](https://www.apple.com/itunes/).
- The iCloud bypass server files from GitHub. You can download them from [here](https://github.com/Ink0gnit0/icloud-bypass-server)[^1^].

## How to Bypass iCloud Activation on iPhone using XAMPP

1. Extract the iCloud bypass server files to a folder on your PC.
2. Copy the files to the htdocs folder in XAMPP. The default location of this folder is C:\xampp\htdocs.
3. Edit the hosts file on your PC. The default location of this file is C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. Add the following line at the end of the file: 127.0.0.1 albert.apple.com. Save and close the file.
4. Run XAMPP Control Panel as administrator. Start Apache and MySQL services by clicking on the Start buttons next to them.
5. Connect your iPhone to your PC using the USB cable. Open iTunes and wait for it to detect your iPhone.
6. You should see a message on iTunes saying that there is a problem with your iPhone and you need to restore it. Click on Restore iPhone and follow the instructions.
7. After the restore process is completed, your iPhone will restart and show the Hello screen. Swipe to unlock and choose your language and country.
8. On the Wi-Fi settings screen, tap on the i icon next to your Wi-Fi network. Tap on Configure DNS and select Manual. Delete any existing DNS servers and add 127.0.0.1 as the only DNS server. Tap on Save.
9. Go back to the Wi-Fi settings screen and tap on Next. Your iPhone will try to activate but it will fail because it will connect to your local XAMPP server instead of Apple's server.
10. You should see a message on your iPhone saying that it is activated. Tap on Continue and set up your iPhone as usual.

## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to bypass iCloud activation on iPhone using XAMPP. This method is not guaranteed to work for all iPhones or iOS versions, and it may have some limitations or risks. For example, you may not be able to use some features or services that require iCloud, such as Find My iPhone, iMessage, FaceTime, App Store, etc. You may also face legal issues if you are using a stolen or lost iPhone without the owner's permission. Therefore, we recommend that you use this method only for educational or entertainment purposes, and not for illegal or unethical purposes.
