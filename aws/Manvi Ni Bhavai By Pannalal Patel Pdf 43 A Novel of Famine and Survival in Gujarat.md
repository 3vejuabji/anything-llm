The novel is set in the village of Kalagadh in Gujarat, where a severe drought has caused crop failure and starvation. The protagonist, Kalu, is a poor farmer who lives with his wife Raju and their son Khima. Kalu tries to cope with the harsh conditions by working as a laborer, selling his cattle, and borrowing money from a moneylender. He also hopes for rain and prays to the goddess Amba. Raju supports her husband and son with her love and courage, but she also suffers from hunger and illness. Khima is a young boy who dreams of becoming a soldier and fighting for his country.
 
The novel depicts the hardships and tragedies that befall Kalu and his family, as well as the other villagers, during the famine. It also portrays the social and cultural aspects of rural life in Gujarat, such as festivals, rituals, customs, superstitions, caste system, and gender roles. The novel is written in a humorous and sarcastic tone, which contrasts with the grim reality of the situation. The novel also explores the themes of human endurance, faith, love, sacrifice, and death.
