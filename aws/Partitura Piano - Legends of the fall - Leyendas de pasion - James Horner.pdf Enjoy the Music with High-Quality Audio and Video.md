Here are some tips to help you play Legends of the Fall on piano:
 
- The piece is in C major, so you don't need to worry about any sharps or flats. However, there are some accidentals (notes that are not in the key) that you need to pay attention to.
- The piece has a 4/4 time signature, which means there are four beats in a measure and a quarter note gets one beat. The tempo is moderato, which means moderately fast.
- The piece has a simple structure: it consists of an introduction, a main theme (A), a variation of the main theme (B), a return of the main theme (A) and an ending. You can use the sheet music as a guide to follow the structure.
- The introduction is four measures long and sets up the mood of the piece. It starts with a single note (C) played by the left hand, followed by a chord (C major) played by both hands. Then, the right hand plays a descending arpeggio (broken chord) from G to C, while the left hand plays a single note (G). Finally, both hands play another chord (C major) together.
- The main theme (A) is 16 measures long and introduces the melody of the piece. It starts with the right hand playing the melody on a high octave, while the left hand plays chords on a low octave. The melody is mostly made up of quarter notes and eighth notes, with some dotted notes and ties to create rhythm and expression. The melody follows a pattern of rising and falling notes, creating a sense of longing and nostalgia. The left hand chords are mostly triads (three-note chords) that match the melody notes. The chords change every two measures or every measure, depending on the harmony.
- The variation of the main theme (B) is 16 measures long and adds some variations to the melody and harmony. It starts with both hands playing chords on different octaves, creating a fuller sound. Then, the right hand plays a variation of the melody on a lower octave, while the left hand plays chords on a higher octave. The variation adds some notes and changes some rhythms to create more interest and contrast. The left hand chords are also more complex than before, using inversions (changing the order of notes in a chord) and extensions (adding more notes to a chord).
- The return of the main theme (A) is 16 measures long and repeats the main theme with some minor changes. It starts with both hands playing chords on different octaves again, but this time with more dynamics (changes in volume) and articulation (how each note is played 8cf37b1e13
