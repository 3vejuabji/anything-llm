The JT8D-7 engine is a low-bypass turbofan engine that was developed by Pratt & Whitney in the 1960s. It was one of the first engines to use a high-pressure core and a low-pressure fan, which improved fuel efficiency and reduced noise. The JT8D-7 variant has a maximum thrust of 14,000 pounds-force and a bypass ratio of 1.1:1. It was certified by the FAA in 1971 and entered service in 1972.
 
The JT8D-7 engine has proven itself to be a highly durable and reliable engine, having completed more than 673 million dependable flying hours since entering service. It was once deemed the workhorse of the industry, with more than 14,750 engines produced. Today, there are still 2,400 engines in use worldwide.
 
The TSS Turbine Sound Studios team has spent countless hours recording and editing the sounds of the JT8D-7 engine from various sources and locations. They have used advanced techniques and tools to create a realistic and immersive sound experience for flight simulator enthusiasts. The JT8D-7 India sound package is a must-have for anyone who wants to fly the Boeing 737 or other JT8D-powered aircraft in FSX or P3D.
