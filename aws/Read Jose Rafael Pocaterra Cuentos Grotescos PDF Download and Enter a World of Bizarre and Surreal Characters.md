The stories are written in a simple and direct language, with vivid descriptions and dialogues. They often use irony, sarcasm and black humor to expose the contradictions and injustices of Venezuelan society. They also show the diversity and richness of the Venezuelan culture, with its regionalisms, folklore and customs.

Here are some more paragraphs:
 
One of the themes that Pocaterra explores in his stories is the relationship between life and death. He portrays death as a constant presence in the lives of his characters, sometimes as a tragedy, sometimes as a relief, sometimes as a joke. He also shows how death can reveal the true nature of people, their fears, their desires, their secrets.
 
Another theme that Pocaterra addresses is the corruption and abuse of power in Venezuela. He denounces the tyranny of GÃ³mez and his cronies, who oppressed and exploited the people. He also criticizes the hypocrisy and cowardice of the elites, who collaborated with the regime or remained silent. He exposes the social inequalities and injustices that affected the poor, the workers, the women and the minorities.
 
A third theme that Pocaterra illustrates is the human condition and its complexity. He creates realistic and believable characters, who have their virtues and flaws, their hopes and frustrations, their joys and sorrows. He depicts them with empathy and humor, without judging or idealizing them. He also explores their psychological and moral conflicts, their dilemmas and choices, their dreams and illusions.
