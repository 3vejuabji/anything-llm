4. Run the program and see if the error is gone.

## Method 2: Register the DLL File Manually
 
Another possible cause of the runtime error at 1 0 cannot import dll is that the dll file is not registered in the Windows registry. The registry is a database that stores information about the programs and settings on your computer. Sometimes, the registry entries for a dll file may get corrupted or deleted, causing the program to fail to load it.
 
To fix this, you can try to register the dll file manually using the Command Prompt. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Identify the name and location of the dll file that is causing the error. You can usually find this information in the error message or in the program folder.
2. Press Windows + R keys to open the Run dialog box. Type cmd and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter keys to run Command Prompt as administrator.
3. In the Command Prompt window, type regsvr32 followed by a space and then the full path of the dll file in quotation marks. For example, if the dll file is called xyz.dll and it is located in C:\Program Files\ABC, type regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\ABC\xyz.dll" and press Enter.
4. You should see a message saying that the dll file was registered successfully. If you see an error message instead, make sure you typed the command correctly and that you have permission to access the dll file.
5. Close the Command Prompt window and restart your computer.
6. Run the program and see if the error is gone.

## Method 3: Scan and Repair System Files
 
A third possible cause of the runtime error at 1 0 cannot import dll is that some system files are damaged or missing. System files are essential for Windows to operate normally and support various programs. If they get corrupted or deleted by malware, viruses, or other factors, they may cause various errors and problems on your computer.
 
To fix this, you can use a built-in tool called System File Checker (SFC) to scan and repair system files. SFC will check for any integrity violations in your system files and attempt to fix them automatically. To use SFC, follow these steps:

1. Press Windows + R keys to open the Run dialog box. Type cmd and press 8cf37b1e13
