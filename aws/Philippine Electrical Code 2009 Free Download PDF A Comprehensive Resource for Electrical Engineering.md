The Philippine Electrical Code (PEC) is a set of rules and regulations that govern the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of electrical systems in the Philippines. The PEC is based on the National Electrical Code (NEC) of the United States, with some modifications to suit the local conditions and practices. The PEC is updated periodically to reflect the latest developments and innovations in the electrical industry.
 
The PEC 2009 is the latest edition of the code, which was approved by the Senate of the Philippines on August 8, 2019. The PEC 2009 covers various topics such as general requirements, wiring and protection, wiring methods and materials, equipment for general use, special occupancies, special equipment, special conditions, communications systems, and tables.
