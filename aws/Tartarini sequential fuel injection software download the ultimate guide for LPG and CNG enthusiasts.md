The installer will extract the files and launch the setup wizard. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
 
## Step 3: Connect your interface cable
 
To use Tartarini sequential fuel injection software, you need to connect your interface cable between your PC and your vehicle's OBD port. The interface cable is a USB device that converts the signals from the ECU controller to the PC. You can buy the interface cable from LPG Shop[^2^] or other online stores. You may also need to install the drivers for the interface cable, which are usually included in the software package or can be downloaded from the manufacturer's website.

## Benefits of Tartarini LPG Systems
 
LPG stands for liquefied petroleum gas, which is a mixture of propane and butane. LPG is an alternative fuel that can be used in vehicles with internal combustion engines. LPG has several benefits over conventional fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. Some of these benefits are:
 
- LPG is cheaper than gasoline and diesel, which can save you money on fuel costs.
- LPG is cleaner than gasoline and diesel, which can reduce your vehicle's emissions and environmental impact.
- LPG is safer than gasoline and diesel, which can prevent fire and explosion hazards.
- LPG is more efficient than gasoline and diesel, which can improve your vehicle's performance and mileage.

Tartarini LPG systems are designed to convert your vehicle from gasoline or diesel to LPG. Tartarini LPG systems consist of several components, such as a gas tank, a gas regulator, a gas injector, a gas filter, a gas switch, and an ECU controller. Tartarini LPG systems are compatible with most types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, etc. Tartarini LPG systems are also certified by various international standards, such as ECE R67-01, ECE R110, ISO 15500, etc.
 
## How to Maintain Tartarini LPG Systems
 
To ensure the optimal performance and longevity of your Tartarini LPG system, you need to maintain it regularly. Maintenance involves checking and replacing some parts of the system that may wear out or malfunction over time. Some of the maintenance tasks that you need to perform are:

- Check the gas tank for leaks, corrosion, or damage. Replace the gas tank if necessary.
- Check the gas regulator for proper functioning and pressure. Adjust or replace the gas regulator if necessary.
- Check the gas injector for clogging or dirt. Clean or replace the gas injector if necessary.
- Check the gas filter for contamination or blockage. Replace the gas filter if necessary.
- Check the gas switch for proper operation and indication. Repair or replace the gas switch if necessary.
- Check the ECU controller for software updates or errors. Update or reset the ECU controller if necessary.

You can perform some of these maintenance tasks yourself, or you can take your vehicle to a professional service center that specializes in Tartarini LPG systems. You should also follow the manufacturer's recommendations on how often to perform maintenance on your Tartarini LPG system. Generally, you should perform maintenance every 10,000 km or every year, whichever comes first.
